# Write a method `savvy_shuffled_sentence` that takes in two sentences.
# The method should return a boolean indicating whether or not the sentences
# consist of the same exact *words*, but not necessarily in the same order.
#
# Your solution should have a linear - O(n) runtime, where n is the combined
# length of the input strings.
#
# Scoring: 8 points maximum
#   4 points awarded for passing all test cases
#   4 points awarded for linear runtime
#
# This component of the assessment is estimated to take 10 minutes.
